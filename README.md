üîê Encrypt & Decrypt - Simple Cipher Project
Overview:
This project implements a basic encryption and decryption mechanism using a randomized substitution cipher. Each character in the input is replaced with another character from a shuffled set, making it difficult to interpret without the key.

Key Features:

Encrypts text using a shuffled version of a defined character set.

Decrypts the text back using the same key.

Handles all standard characters: space, alphabets, digits, and punctuation.

Preserves any unknown or unlisted characters during encryption/decryption.

How It Works:

A character set is created using:

python
Copy
Edit
chars = " " + string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
A key is generated by shuffling this set.

Each character in the plaintext is mapped to a character at the same index in the shuffled key.

For decryption, the reverse mapping is applied.
